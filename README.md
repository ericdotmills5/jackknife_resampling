# Project Description

I am planning this project to be an online Jackknife resampling tool using an input .csv file; it will be programmed in C. This project is designed to complement my dad's research paper on neuroscience and using Jackknife resampling to analyse his primary data. The research paper is currently in the process of being edited and will be published soon. Once it is ready, I will begin working on this project to apply the jackknife resampling techniques my dad used for his research.

## Jackknife Resampling

Jackknife resampling is a statistical technique used to estimate the bias and variance of a statistical estimator. It involves systematically leaving out one or more observations from a dataset and recalculating the estimator multiple times. This method allows for the assessment of the stability and reliability of the estimator, particularly when dealing with large datasets.

In the context of my dad's research paper, jackknife resampling will be applied to analyze the massive amount of primary data he has collected in the field of neuroscience. By systematically resampling subsets of the data, we can assess the robustness of the statistical analysis and draw more accurate conclusions from the findings.
